## Init kickstart

There are a few settings that I was starting to tweak from kickstart.nvim. Now I want them on my other machines, and I want to be able to update the kickstart script whenever without blowing away my changes.

I was also trying to use github copilot while writing a bash script. It might have been a little more trouble than it was worth, but I learned a lot more of the essentials around bash scripting while trying to debug code that I didn't write.
